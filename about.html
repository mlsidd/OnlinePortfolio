      <p style="font-family: 'Lobster', cursive;" class="aboutPara aboutColor">My name is Melissa Siddoway and I currently reside in Houston, Tx. I am an elementary school teacher working to become a computer programmer.</p>
      <p style="font-family: 'Lobster', cursive;" class="aboutPara aboutColor">I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a BBA in Finance and minor in Accounting in 2006. I worked for a year as a Tax Consultant at Ryan & Company in Houston, Tx. I then received my alternative teaching certification and began my teaching career as a 5th grade Science Teacher in Aldine ISD. I worked in this position for 7 years before changing to an elementary school in Aldine ISD and working as a Math and Reading Interventionist. It was during my 3 years in this position that I began to realize my desire to learn about computer programming. As an interventionist, I worked with lots of student data. I also frequently needed data input from classroom teachers. Additionally, I found myself needing to send emails to teachers quite often. After finding this process to be tedius and inefficient, I began exploring what could be accomplished with Google Apps Scripts. I quickly discovered how to create a script that could send an email through a Google spreadsheet. It was through this process of discovering ways to make my workflow much more efficient that first triggered my fascination with coding. This fascination led me to the UT Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp where I have loved learning how to "talk" to my computer and develop really cool things along the way. I accomplished so much during this 6 month intensive bootcamp and cannot wait to accomplish even more.  The camp, combined with my dedicated, hard-working attitude has given me the skills I need to learn any new programming language as well as continue to develop the languages I used during the camp.  More importantly, I have always loved learning especially something that I have a growing passion for.</p> 
      <p style="font-family: 'Lobster', cursive;" class="aboutPara aboutColor">On a more personal note, I love running and have completed 5 half marathons with more on the horizon. In my free time I love to excercise, play with my 3 kids and my puppy Morgan, host game nights with friends, go biking, and go on outdoor adventures.</p>
